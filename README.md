A libpurple/Pidgin plugin for [signald](https://git.callpipe.com/finn/signald) (signal, formerly textsecure).

signald is written by Finn Herzfeld.

I never wrote code for use in Pidgin before. EionRobb's [purple-discord](https://github.com/EionRobb/purple-discord) sources were of great help. 

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04. An unofficial IRC channel exists on Freenode called `##purple-signald` for those who use it.

Windows users may take a sneak peek at [purple-signal](https://github.com/hoehermann/purple-signal).

### Known Issues

There have been reports of incoming offline-messages getting lost. As far as I observed, they are not lost but delayed and delivered after a restart of signald.
